# Task 5 report: guarded EZZK settings controls

## Changes

- Replaced the EZZK password-login settings card with guarded environment and session controls.
- Sandbox remains the default environment. The portal URL, REST API URL, and authority identity are rendered from the fixed `EZZKEnvironment` values. Production remains visibly closed while the authority gate is false.
- Added session state, last successful connectivity check, available evidence-number count, and the actions `Prihlásiť cez EZZK`, `Obnoviť session`, and `Odhlásiť`.
- Login is disabled until the native OAuth callback is configured and explains that EZZK operator configuration is required. No token or arbitrary endpoint is displayed.
- Kept IČO, username, and password out of the authentication UI and explicitly described them as legacy migration data. Existing notification and eDesk fields remain separate migration contact metadata.
- Added an explicit evidence-number request with positive-count validation and a confirmation dialog. The request is action-triggered only and leaves local evidence records untouched on failure.
- Added a disabled signed ASiC-E submission state explaining that the current workflow has neither a validated signed file nor the required EZZK capability. No `ConversionRecordEnvelope` metadata is sent as a fake submission.
- Added presentation-facing session accessors and a successful connectivity timestamp to `EZZKSessionController`.

## Verification

- Focused tests: `swift test --build-path /tmp/ezzk-task5-tests --filter EZZKEnvironmentTests`
  - PASS, 11 tests, 0 failures.
- App build: `swift build --product Autogram --build-path /tmp/ezzk-task5-build`
  - PASS, Autogram product built successfully.

Existing project warnings remain in unrelated files and were not changed.

## Concerns

- Native EZZK login remains intentionally disabled until the operator supplies and registers the confirmed native redirect URI and callback scheme.
- Production remains intentionally unavailable behind the closed authority gate.
- The signed ASiC-E upload and authoritative receipt capability is not yet exposed by the current workflow, so the Settings submission control remains disabled.
- No additional UI test target exists in this package. The focused AutogramKit environment tests cover the fixed identity and native callback prerequisites; app-target presentation state was verified through the successful product build.

## Review fix

- Guarded `canStartLogin` against the `.authenticating` state so a second click cannot start a concurrent OAuth attempt or invalidate the first login operation.
- No AutogramApp test target exists, and the requested focused tests are scoped to AutogramKit, so this app-state regression has no feasible isolated XCTest coverage without changing package boundaries.
